# Assignment before class: Revised introduction

## **few sentences for summary**

This study considers the continuing globalization with its subsequent
growing interconnectedness between scientists at different universities
and the reducing psychic distance to seek further understanding of the
relationship between geographical distance and the collaboration
networks of social scientists at Dutch universities. The study is
carried out in two-fold: firstly, the collaboration network between
Sociology departments at Dutch universities will be studied, secondly,
the within-department collaboration network of scientists within the
Sociology department at Radboud University will analysed. To do this, a
social network perspective will be applied to uncover the structure of
the collaboration networks.

## **Introduction – Geographical distance and co-authorship collaboration network analysis**

Over the last few centuries, globalization processes have resulted in
economic, political and cultural interdependence, supported by an
immense worldwide network of international connections and collaboration
(Gui et al., 2019). According to some, the globalization of science is
the most important aspect of modern globalization (Freeman, 2010). The
subsequent knowledge flows are beneficial for economic development and
specialization, networking, and the competitiveness in the scientific
field (Gui et al., 2019). Additionally, globalization has created a
large international collaboration network that benefits both students
and teachers when seeking specific knowledge and specializations
(Fitzgerald et al., 2021). While globalization is not able to shrink
geographical distances in a literal sense, our individual perception and
awareness of the distance between us and a secondary location, also
referred to as ‘psychic distance’, has decreased as a result of
globalization (Ojala, 2009). That is, communication methods, such as
phones, e-mail, and other telecommunication technologies have made it
much easier to reach out to others who are not directly in our immediate
vicinity (Hoekman et al., 2010). While this relation has been proven for
long-distance, international scientific collaboration (e.g. Hoekman et
al., 2010), little research has been done on the relationship between
geographical distance and scientific collaboration networks on a
singular country and organizational level. While it can be expected to
be less evident, geographical distance can still be expected to be a
relevant factor in scientific collaboration networks between actors
within a country. -elaborate on WHY- This study aims to do so by
studying geographical distance and co-authorship collaboration networks
in the Netherlands, resulting in the following research question: [RQ1a]
To what extent does the geographical distance between Sociology
departments at Dutch universities influence the between-university
collaboration network of scientists located at these universities? Broad
societal changes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2022
had possibly lasting consequences for scientific collaboration networks.
That is, government mandated measures such as working from home, limited
travelling and avoiding close contact to others, might have changed the
way these networks were constructed. This study will look at changing
spatial patterns of research collaboration by studying co-authorship
over time, resulting in the following questions: [RQ1b] To what extent
has the relation between geographical distance and between-university
collaboration networks of Dutch Sociology departments changed over time?
And: [RQ1c] What patterns can be discovered within the collaboration
network?

Moreover, this study will attempt to deepen our understanding of these
effects by looking at the relation between physical distance and
collaboration networks on an even smaller scale. At the organizational
level, a relation between psychic distance between two scientists and
collaboration activities might exist as well. Scientists who work within
close proximity might run into each other more often than those who work
at opposite ends of a building. Regular interaction on the work floor
can spark ideas and interest in collaboration (SOURCE). RQ2a: To what
extent does the geographical distance within the Sociology department at
Radboud University influence the within-department collaboration network
of scientists within this department? Similar to the previous set of
research questions, this study will also look into changes in
collaboration activities over time within a university department.
Studying these changes can provide insight into the extent to which
broader societal changes (e.g. a global pandemic) and
organizational-level developments (e.g. department relocation) influence
collaboration networks on a small spatial scale. For example, the
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2022 might have
resulted different collaboration activities within the department as
employees were forced to work from home, thereby possibly experiencing
greater psychic distance and missing out on the daily meeting
opportunities that can spark collaboration interests. At an
organizational level, the relocation of Radboud’s whole social science
department to a new building in 2021 might have resulted in a shift
within the previous collaboration structure. This results in the
following questions: [RQ2b] To what extent has the relation between
geographical distance and within-department collaboration network
changed over time? And [RQ2c] What patterns can be discovered within the
collaboration network?

## RQ's op een rijtje:

RQ1: descriptive To what extent does the geographical distance between
Sociology departments at Dutch universities influence the
between-university collaboration network of scientists located at these
universities?

-   To what extent has this changed over time?

-   What patterns can be discovered within the collaboration network?

RQ2: CASE STUDY: To what extent does the geographical distance within
the Sociology department at Radboud University (or Groningen University)
influence the within-department collaboration network of scientists
within this department?

-   To what extent has this changed over time?

-   What patterns can be discovered within the collaboration network?
